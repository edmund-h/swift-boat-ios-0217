     Give your new Boat class four properties:
     
     a string constant named name,
     a mutable array of Strings named sailors,
     a mutable Double named maxSpeedKnots, and
     a mutable Double named speedKnots with a default value of zero.
     Write a designated initializer that covers the name, sailors, and maxSpeedKnots properties. It should not interact with speedKnots which already has a value of zero.
     
     Write a convenience initializer that accepts arguments for name and maxSpeedKnots. It should call the designated initializer, passing its two arguments along, and passing an empty array of type String to the sailors argument.
